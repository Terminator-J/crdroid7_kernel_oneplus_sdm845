## Hola amiguitos

This is my attempt to add a little crDroid customization flavor back into the sdm845 kernel tree for OnePlus 6 & 6T (enchilada & fajita).

- Rebased on bananafunction's lineage-20-test branch as of July 2024 (post-final update I guess ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ).
- Merged official LineageOS lineage-21 branch as of December 2024 for U+ compatibility & retrofit dynamic partition support.
- Merged official LineageOS lineage-20 branch of common android_kernel_qcom_sdm845 kernel as of December 2024.
- Other goodies gathered from over the years including work from Anierin Bliss, mcdachpappe, EmanuelCN, snnbyyds, arter97, kerneltoast, etc (among others I'm sure).
